# Template README file for in-class partner shell script writing exercise

The goal is to create a well-commented bash shell script that:

1. Creates a proper minimal project directory structure.
2. Downloads a zip file of 4 fasta files from the following URL: http://npk.io/NB6Y5a+
3. Unzips the file using the `unzip` command. Windows users may need to install this program first, by typing `sudo apt install unzip`. You will be asked for the password you entered when you set up Ubuntu.
4. Prints out the sequence names and the sequence counts for each of the files.

Throughout this process, you should be adding and committing the script after each new feature is added and works.

Then, when you are done, push the changes back to GitHub and open a pull request back to the class's organization repo.
